                <li>The player is presented with the option to choose between batting and bowling, each having only one chance.</li>
                <li>If the player chooses to bat, they, as the batsman, select a number (1-6) to score runs. Simultaneously, the computer bowls a random number.</li>
                <li>If the chosen number matches the computer's, it results in an out, and roles switch—the computer bats, and the player bowls. If the numbers differ, the runs are added to the player's score.</li>
                <li>On the bowling side, the player, now acting as the bowler, predicts the computer's number to take wickets. A correct prediction results in a wicket; otherwise, the computer scores runs.</li>
                <li>The game continues until a target score is reached. The player with the highest total score emerges as the winner of Num Cricket.</li>
                <li>If the player opts for bowling, the computer bats, and the player must predict the computer’s number. A correct prediction leads to an out. </li>
                <li>The player needs to score more runs than the computer to win; otherwise, they lose.</li>
